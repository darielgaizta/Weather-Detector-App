# Weather-Detector-App
Named from it's functionality, this web-based app can detect the current weather in a particular city. This app will take a city name as an input from user and show its name, country code, weather, current time, coordinate of the city, temperature, pressure, and humidity. The app actually has settings.py in WeatherDetector. It is not pushed because it contains SECRET_KEY of this project and even though the file is pushed, GitHub will give a warning. Note that every Django project has its own SECRET_KEY.
